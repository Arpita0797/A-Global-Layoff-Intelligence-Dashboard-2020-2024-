## üìä Project Overview

This project dives deep into **global layoff data** to uncover patterns in how different industries, countries, and company stages were affected between **2020 and 2024**.
Using advanced **SQL queries**, this analysis helps answer key business questions such as:

* Which industries faced the largest layoffs?
* Which companies were hit the hardest each year?
* How do funding stages impact layoff rates?
* What is the correlation between company funding and workforce stability?

The project demonstrates your ability to **clean, aggregate, and analyze large datasets** using SQL, turning raw data into valuable business insights.

---

## üß† What This Project Showcases

This project highlights your ability to:

* Write **complex SQL queries** involving subqueries, joins, and window functions.
* Perform **data cleaning** and handle missing or inconsistent values.
* Apply **analytical reasoning** to uncover data-driven trends.
* Derive **real-world insights** useful for decision-making in HR analytics, finance, and business strategy.

---

## üß© Dataset Overview

The dataset captures detailed information on global layoffs, including:

* Company name and headquarters location
* Industry and stage of funding (Seed, Series A, IPO, etc.)
* Number of employees laid off
* Percentage of workforce affected
* Total funds raised
* Date of layoff event
* Source of information

Each record represents a company layoff event between **2020 and 2024**, providing a multi-year view of global employment dynamics.

## ‚öôÔ∏è SQL Concepts Used

Throughout the project, the following SQL techniques were applied:

* **Aggregate Functions** ‚Üí `SUM()`, `COUNT()`, `AVG()`, `ROUND()`
* **Grouping & Filtering** ‚Üí `GROUP BY`, `HAVING`, `WHERE`
* **Sorting & Ranking** ‚Üí `ORDER BY`, `LIMIT`
* **Joins and Subqueries** ‚Üí For identifying top companies by year
* **NULL Handling** ‚Üí Using  `NULLIF()` to prevent divide-by-zero errors

---

## üîç Key Insights

* The **technology industry** experienced the highest number of layoffs globally.
* **Early-stage startups** (Seed and Series A) had the **highest layoff-to-funding ratios**, indicating financial instability.
* The **United States** accounted for the largest share of total layoffs.
* **Post-IPO and acquired companies** showed better resilience compared to those in earlier funding rounds.
* Layoff ratios generally **declined as companies matured**, moving from Seed ‚Üí Series J ‚Üí IPO.

FROM layoffs_data 
GROUP BY YEAR,Company
) AS S
JOIN (
SELECT  YEAR, MAX(LAYOFF_PER_COMPANY) AS MAX_LAYOFF 
FROM (
SELECT YEAR(Lay_off_date) AS YEAR, Company,SUM(Laid_Off_Count) AS LAYOFF_PER_COMPANY

## üßæ Data Cleaning Highlights

Before running analysis queries, several cleaning operations were performed:

* Removed rows where `Industry = 'Unknown'`.
* Standardized inconsistent stage names (e.g., ‚ÄúUknown‚Äù ‚Üí ‚ÄúUnknown‚Äù).
* Filtered out null or invalid values from `Lay_off_date` and `Funds_Raised`.
* Converted `Lay_off_date` to proper **DATE format** for yearly analysis.
* **For Example : **
  
```sql
SET SQL_SAFE_UPDATES = 0;

UPDATE layoffs_raw
SET
  Laid_Off_Count = NULLIF(Laid_Off_Count, ''),
  Funds_raised = NULLIF(Funds_raised, ''),
  Percentage_laid_off = NULLIF(Percentage_laid_off, ''),
  Lay_off_date = NULLIF(Lay_off_date, '');

UPDATE layoffs_raw
SET Laid_Off_Count = NULL
WHERE Laid_Off_Count NOT REGEXP '^[0-9]+$';

UPDATE layoffs_raw
SET Funds_raised = NULL
WHERE Funds_raised NOT REGEXP '^[0-9]+$';

UPDATE layoffs_raw
SET Percentage_laid_off = NULL
WHERE Percentage_laid_off NOT REGEXP '^[0-9.]+$';

UPDATE layoffs_raw
SET Lay_off_date = NULL
WHERE Lay_off_date NOT REGEXP '^[0-9]{2}-[0-9]{2}-[0-9]{4}$';

SET SQL_SAFE_UPDATES = 1;


```

## üìà Insights Summary

The analysis revealed that global layoffs are **not only influenced by industry trends**, but also by **funding maturity** and **economic cycles**.
Startups in their early funding stages (Seed, Series A, and B) tend to **overhire during growth phases** and then **downsize sharply** when funding tightens.

By contrast, companies that reached IPO or acquisition stages managed to maintain better workforce stability.
