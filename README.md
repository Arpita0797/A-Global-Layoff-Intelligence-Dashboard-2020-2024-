# A-Global-Layoff-Intelligence-Dashboard-2020-2024-

Global Layoff Intelligence Dashboard (2020–2024)

An interactive Power BI dashboard offering deep analysis of global tech layoffs across companies, countries, and funding stages from 2020 to 2024.

🛠 Tools & Technologies Used

This project was built using the following tools for their strengths in data modeling, transformation, and storytelling:

Power BI: Chosen for its rich visual capabilities, interactive dashboards, and ability to share insights in real-time with stakeholders.

DAX (Data Analysis Expressions): Used for advanced measures, time intelligence, and dynamic calculations such as layoff changes, percentage distributions, and correlation scores.

Power Query : Used for robust data cleaning, shaping, and transformation — handling inconsistent date formats, missing values, and aggregating data across time.


📂 About the Dataset

Source: Layoffs.fyi dataset on Kaggle as it provided comprehensive public data on global tech layoffs, including company names, dates, roles affected, funding stages, and countries.

Fields: Company, country, date, industry, number laid off, total staff, % laid off, funding stage

Time Range: 2020–2024

Granularity: Company-level events, enabling drill-down analysis by time, stage, and geography

🧩 Features and Highlights 

❗ Business Problem

The tech sector has faced massive volatility, with tens of thousands of layoffs. Decision-makers lacked a centralized, visual platform to monitor these trends, assess risks, and plan strategic responses.


🎯 Dashboard Objective

To provide a data-driven, visual decision support tool that allows:

Monitoring tech-sector layoff patterns across years and regions

Identifying high-risk companies, startup stages, and funding scenarios

Guiding investment, hiring, and operational decisions using historical layoff patterns


🧭 Key Visuals Walkthrough


Time Series Line Chart: Displays layoffs over time (by month and year), highlighting peak layoff periods in 2022 and 2023.

Clustered Bar Chart: Shows the companies with the highest number of layoffs (e.g., Amazon, Meta, Google), allowing for quick company-level comparison.

Geographic Heat Map: Visualizes the geographic distribution of layoffs by country to assess regional impact and economic volatility.

Stacked Column Chart: Breaks down layoffs by startup funding stage (Seed, Series A, Series B, Post-IPO, etc.) over time, helping to identify which stages were hit hardest.

Area Chart: Plots total funding raised vs. layoff percentage, helping to explore any correlation (or lack thereof) between capital raised and workforce reductions.

Interactive Filters (Slicers): Let users drill down by year, country, company, and startup stage, tailoring the insights to specific questions or regions.


💡 Business Insights & Impact


📈 2023 was the most turbulent year, with 260K+ layoffs globally

🏢 Amazon led with over 28K job cuts, followed by other tech giants

🌐 Layoffs were concentrated in North America, but widespread across Europe and Asia

🚀 Post-IPO startups were the most impacted funding stage, suggesting market pressure on public companies

💸 No significant correlation between funding raised and layoffs, indicating that layoffs are influenced more by operational or market strategy than by available capital
